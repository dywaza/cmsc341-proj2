====================================
Notes about the project

* For some reason, the indexing of my IF/THEN function quits a little
erradically. I tried my best to contain it by forcing a nextIndex when
the ENDIF is reached, but sometimes it throws errors anyways.

Sadly, in the spirit of the Law of Diminishing Returns, I had to move
on. In these cases, I simply put a wildcard character "#" to act as a 
"dummy symbol" and allow the program to continue normally.

* Also, there are comments EVERYWHERE. Pardon the mess.

Now, it is 3 am, and I am going to sleep. Good night, Professor Park.
